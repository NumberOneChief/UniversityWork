I used Mamp to manage the databases and create dummy databases to test against.
I copied actual data from the webProperty table at Admiral which i have added
below if needed to add and test against. It is quite easy to set up a database
in Mamp. follow this guide if needed ( https://goo.gl/Ne2wdZ )

The Databases have been created with names "WebProperties" and the second "WebProperties2
If you follow this namimng of the databases then you will not need to change any files
The tables have the same name in both databases "WebProperties". If you follow the same
name convention then you will not need to change anything. 

The structure of the database is ID, Brand, Key, Value. Follow this for no changes needed.  

| 2					| 3					| 4					|
| Bell				| Diamond			| Elephant			|	
| dev.switch.brand	| dev.switch.brand	| dev.switch.brand	|	
| yes				| no				| no				|
 
When the database is set up the program can be run from the main class and the main method

When run the results will be self explanatory in the console.
